00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So we are at Nepata College now and we are doing some work.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you want to say something random, just say it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't say anything.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just say it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Just say it.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why don't you say it?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In which case do you want to check?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just like you are taking out a text.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In this case, Google and Wikipedia are doing their work.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I won't say anything.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just do it for a minute.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's see how long it will take.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I won't say anything.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay sir.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's been 40 seconds.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Nepali to English.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Just say whatever you want.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We love you.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We love you.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We love you.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you.
